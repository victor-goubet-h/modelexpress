"""Shard digests for the reshard refit path.

A refit that reports plausible timings can still install the wrong bytes: the wire
can deliver correctly while the *plan* points a copy at the wrong sub-box, and
generation-level metrics such as KL against a reference are too coarse to localise
that. This module supplies the cheap half of the answer - a digest a publisher can
compute over the shard it owns, and which a receiver can recompute over the bytes it
actually received - so a mismatch names the offending tensor instead of showing up
as a slightly worse loss curve three steps later.

Why not a byte hash: hashing 30 GB per rank per refit on the GPU means either a
device-side hash kernel we do not have, or a copy to host we cannot afford. The
digest below is a *position-sensitive* reduction instead - see :func:`tensor_digest`
for why plain sums are not enough.

This module is the digest and the wire format for it. The receiver-side gate that
recomputes and compares is deliberately not here; it needs the fresh-discovery
refresh to avoid reporting ordinary training updates as corruption, which is its own
change. Publishing is opt-in via ``MX_RESHARD_PUBLISH_DIGEST`` because the reduction
costs a pass over every published tensor.
