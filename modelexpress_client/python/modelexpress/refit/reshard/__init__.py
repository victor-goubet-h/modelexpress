"""No-gather sharded weight resharding (trainer -> inference), vended by MX.

A framework-neutral core for slice-level weight transfer: capture which slice of
each full source tensor an engine's own weight loader reads (geometry.py),
intersect those slices against the published source shards (slice_plan.py), and
emit the exact byte segments to RDMA-pull (plan.py). No all-gather and no
per-model conversion specs - the engine's real loaders define the reshard.

Overlap is arbitrary per-dim (not just dim-0). Descriptor-heavy strided copies
can pull a complete dim-0-sharded source into contiguous staging and replay the
captured views locally. Any tensor whose placement cannot be represented safely
raises ``UnsupportedReshard``. The receiver fails the update before transfer
because a general fallback path is not implemented.
